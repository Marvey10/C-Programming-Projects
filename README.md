# C Programming School Projects

This repository contains my school projects developed in C programming language.  
These projects allowed me to practice and understand:  
- Basic syntax and control structures in C  
- Functions and modular programming  
- Pointers and memory management  
- File input/output  
- Problem-solving and algorithm implementation

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run a project, use a C compiler like `gcc`:  
```bash
gcc project1.c -o project1
./project1
